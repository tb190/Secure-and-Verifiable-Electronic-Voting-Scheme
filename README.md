# Secure-and-Verifiable-Electronic-Voting-Scheme
The proposed electronic voting scheme was formally verified using two automated verification tools provided by AVISPA framework: OFMC (On-the-Fly Model Checker) and CL-AtSe (Constraint-Logic-based Attack Searcher).

The results from both tools indicate that the analyzed phases of the proposed scheme are secure with respect to the secrecy goals.
